# YellowPage-Pythonscrapper
An YP web scrapper in Python.
The Python web scrapper crawls yellowpages based on business and locality given as input.
It sends out a suggestion based on query as an email notification.
e.g. If you are in a new city and you need a quick suggestion for a pizza place, you just need to provide name of the city and 'pizza'
as input. You will get a random suggestion as email notification.
